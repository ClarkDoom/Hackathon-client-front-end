## Getting Started

Note that both the front-end and back-end are included in this "mono-repo".
The front-end is in the client directory.
The back-end is in the server directory.

### Installation

Steps to install the project on a local machine.

`Fork and clone the repo`

In your terminal:
    While in the client directory, run
        `npm i`
        `npm run dev`

    While in the server directory, run
        `npm i`
        `nodemon`

## Usage

Both the front-end and back-end must be running to load the app localy. 
You will also need to setup your own SQL server, and modify the back-end code to point to that server.

To side-step that, you can navigate directly to pages in the location bar of your browser:
    `'/level1'`
    `'/worlds'`
    This method may cause some assets (images) to not load property.
